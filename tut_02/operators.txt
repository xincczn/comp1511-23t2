OPERATORS

Arithmetic
+: addition, adding two numerical values together
-: substraction, minus two numerical values together
*: multiplication, times two numerical values together
/: division, divides two numerical values together
%: modulo, (A % B), mods A by B, returning remainder

Logical
||: (A OR B), if either are true, the statement is true
&&: (A AND B), only if both are true, the statement is true
!: (NOT A), negates the boolean, changing false to true and vice versa

Comparison
>: (A > B), checks if A is strictly greater than B
>=: (A >= B), checks if A is greater or equal to B
<: (A < B), checks if A is strictly less than B
<=: (A <= B), checks if A is less or equal to B
!=: (A != B), checks if both are not matching in numerical values
==: (A == B), checks if both are matching in numerical values

Bitwise operators that aren't covered nor used in this course.
COMP1521 will showcase these.
Avoid using singular & and | as these work differently.

^: XOR
>>: Bitshift right
<<: Bitshift left 
&: AND
|: OR
